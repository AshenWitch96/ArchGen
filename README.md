# 🏛️ ArchGen – Generative AI Architecture Design Assistant

ArchGen is a generative AI-powered design assistant that creates conceptual building and architectural visuals from natural language prompts. It uses a **LoRA fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model**, specifically trained on a diverse dataset of architectural designs.

> 🔥 Deployed on [Tensor.Art](https://tensor.art)  
> 🚀 Over **7,000+ generation runs**

## 🧠 What is ArchGen?

With ArchGen, you can input descriptive prompts like:

- *"Modern glass house on a cliff"*
- *"Ancient stone temple in a forest"*
- *"High-tech startup office with neon lights"*

And get back **AI-generated architectural renderings** that match your description.
